## Disclaimer

This library is still under rapid development. The API will likely change as I continue to reverse engineer the rover. Use at your own risk.

## Usage

```javascript
var rover = require('rover');
var async = require('async');

var client = rover.createClient();

client.forward(cb);
client.backward(cb);
client.right(cb);
client.left(cb);

client.cameraUp(30, cb); // 30 deg up
client.cameraDown(30, cb); // 30 deg down

client.config(function(err, cfg){
  // get all device config info
})

client.config('power', function(err, power){
  // get specific field from device config
});

client.networks(function(err, wifiNetworks){
  // list all wifi networks the rover can pick up
});

client.wifi(function(err, info){
  // get info on wireless connection
  // like noise, strength, etc.
});

client.recordLight(true, function(err){
  // turn little red camera light on
  client.recordLight(false, function(err){
    // turn little red camera light off
  }); 
});
```

## CLI

Make sure you are connected to the rover WiFi before starting this.

```
sudo npm install rover -g
rover

w - forward
a - left
s - backward
d - right
arrow up - camera up
arrow down - camera down
<space> - stop
```
